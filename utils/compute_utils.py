    """
    Execute an Abaqus finite element analysis (FEA) simulation via the command line and monitor execution state.

    This function:
    - Launches Abaqus in multithreaded mode using the specified input file.
    - Checks for the `.lck` lock file to determine if the job is still running.
    - Periodically polls system processes to detect potential errors (e.g., stalled 'pre' or 'package' modules).
    - Forces termination if runtime exceeds 60 minutes or specific error conditions are detected.
    - Returns a completion or failure message based on observed status.

    Args:
        Path (str): Absolute path to the directory containing the `.inp` file and target working directory.
        jobName (str): Base name of the Abaqus job (used to construct `.inp` and `.lck` filenames).
        InpFile (str): Filename of the Abaqus input file (typically ends with `.inp`).
        cpus (int): Number of CPU threads to use during the analysis (parallel execution).

    Returns:
        str: Status message indicating whether Abaqus completed successfully, failed to launch,
             terminated due to time constraints, or was killed due to preprocessor/package errors.

    Raises:
        RuntimeError: If the working directory cannot be changed or if subprocess execution fails
                      (currently unhandled, but could be added for robustness).

    Notes:
        - Uses `subprocess.check_output()` to launch Abaqus; assumes it is on system PATH.
        - Requires the `psutil` package (`psu` alias) for process inspection.
        - Designed to support batch or automated job execution in high-throughput environments.
        - Logs execution progress using a custom `log_message(...)` function (assumed to be defined externally).
